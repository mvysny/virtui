# The structural root of the {Screen}'s component tree.
#
# {Screen} is a singleton runtime owner (event loop, lock, terminal IO,
# invalidation set). All actual UI lives under a {ScreenPane}: the tiled
# {#content}, the modal {#popups} stack, and the bottom {#status_bar}.
# Putting them under a single Component parent gives focus traversal a real
# root, makes {Component#attached?} a one-liner, and lets popup-focus repair
# fall out of the standard {Component#on_child_removed} hook.
#
# The pane is not a {Component::Layout}: popups deliberately overlap content
# (Z-ordered, full overdraw, no clipping) and key/mouse dispatch follows
# modal-popup rules rather than active-child dispatch.
